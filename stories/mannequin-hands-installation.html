            <p>In the heart of San Francisco's bustling streets, an unusual installation invites passersby to pause and ponder. "Hands of Change," created by the visionary artist Maya Torres, features a series of mannequin hands extending from a city wall,
                each holding different objects that symbolize various societal issues — from peace and war to environmentalism and consumerism.</p>

        <section class="art-story-details">
            <p>The installation has quickly become a focal point for dialogue and reflection. Each hand tells a story, representing the struggles and hopes of our time. By choosing mannequin hands, Torres emphasizes the silence of those affected by these
                issues, urging onlookers to lend their voices to the voiceless.</p>

            <p>Located in an alley known for its vibrant street art, "Hands of Change" distinguishes itself through its interactive nature and the compelling message it carries. Viewers are encouraged not just to observe but to engage — to consider what
                object they would hold if given a chance and what message they would like to send to the world.</p>

            <p>Torres's work is a powerful reminder of art's role in society — not merely to beautify spaces, but to provoke thought, inspire change, and foster community dialogue. "Hands of Change" stands as a testament to the belief that even in silence,
                a profound conversation can begin.</p>
